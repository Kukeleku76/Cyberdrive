<strong>Damaging rage</strong>:

Maniacs enjoy painful and physically difficult situations a lot. They even become stronger and do more damage in those situations.
<br>
At 1st level, you have 2 options. 
<br>
<br>
<strong>1: Fire</strong>
<br>
Whenever you are on fire, you deal 2d6 extra damage, but you take 1d6 fire damage on the end of every of your turns. Can last depending on what set you on fire. This damage increases 3d8 at 8th level, 4d10 at 13th level, 5d12 at 17th level and 6d20 at 19th level
<br>
<br>
<strong>2: Coldness</strong>
<br>
Whenever you are very cold, you heal 5 + your Maniac’s level hit points per the end of your turn. This does reduce your movement with 5 feet. Can last for 3 rounds.
<br>
<br>
At 5th level, you gain the ability to, whenever hit by lightning, deal 2d12 extra thunder damage for the next 3 turns to a target.
<br>
<br>
At 11th level, whenever you stand in acid, you regain 2 times your Maniac’s level of hit points per the end of your turn. This can never go higher than your hit point maximum. 
<br>
<br>
At 15th level, whenever you take any sort of piercing slashing or bludgeoning damage, as a reaction, you can deal 2d8 of damage with any weapon that you have on you to the person who damaged you. You do need to make a hit roll in order to see if the reaction hits the opponent. 
<br>
<br>
At 17th level, whenever you take any sort of self-harming damage (like fire), you can hit twice in 1 action and you can use your bonus action to dodge, disengage, use an item or use a weapon. 
<br>
<br>

<br>
Whenever you hit someone with life drain, it deals 2d12 of damage to the opponents’ maximum hit points, were the amount of damage your opponent took, is the amount that you get added up to your hit point maximum. Your maximum only increases, your current health doesn’t. You can use this attack once per day
<br>

<br>
<br>
<strong>Mask</strong>:
<br>
Whenever you use your mask to intimidate someone, you can choose to either,
<br>
1: Throw with advantage, when you would normally have disadvantage at this throw, and you use the mask, it is considered as a normal throw.
